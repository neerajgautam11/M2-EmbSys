### Heating Core
Heater Core used in heating the cabin of a vehicle.

### Heating Control Engine
The warmth from the engine goes from the radiator to the heater core, which basically acts as a heat exchanger.

### Water Pump
A working water pump is vital for the engine; if the water pump doesn't work, the engine will overheat.

### Hot Coolant
The hot coolant passes down through the radiator, it cools down.

### Thermistor
When the engine reaches normal operating temperature, the thermostat opens, allowing the flow of hot coolant through the radiator. 
The thermistor controls the temperature of the boiler water. On one terminal, it connects to the temperature setting or the potentiometer.

### Radiators
Radiators work through a heat transfer process called convection. When water in the radiator is heated, the surrounding air is also heated up via convection and this hot air is then moved around the room as the air circulates.

### Blower Motor
The blower motor turns the blower fan, sending the air through your air ducts and into the car . 

### Hot Water Valve
It Desires water temperature and then the valve mixes hot water from your tank with regular cold water until it gives you the temperature you want.
 
### Cabin Air Filter
An air cabin filter is an important component in any vehicle's heating System. It helps protect the passengers from contaminants in the air they breathe.
 
### Fresh Air
Adding fresh air to a heating system accomplishes two primary indoor air quality goals. It pressurizes a building and increases indoor air quality by diluting  polluted or stale indoor air.
 
### Coolant Expansion Tank
It allows the coolant, the antifreeze, and the air in the system to expand with rising temperature and pressure.

## Atmega 328
It enables to measure the heat output as well as control a circulation pump.
## Sensors
If your vehicle has automatic climate control, it uses sensors to monitor the cabin, and then opens or closes the blend doors and outside flap as needed to maintain the         temperature have Been set.
## Power Supply
The purpose of a mains power supply is to convert the power delivered to its input by the sinusoidally alternating mains electricity supply into power available at its output in the form of a smooth and constant direct voltage.
## Heater Core
Heater Core basically acts as a heat exchanger. It allows coolant to flow through, and this flow of coolant is regulated by the heater control valve. As the engine's heat is carried by coolant into the heater core, the device starts to get warm.
## LED
When this Led flicks , it means that the coolant level is running low. It may also mean the possibility of the engine overheating and you need to stop your vehicle immediately.
